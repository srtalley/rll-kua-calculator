Small plants are excellent in this direction as are flowers -- particularly those that bloom in water, such as lilies or lotus.  Water is also excellent in this location for you, so consider having a fountain or aquarium here.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Growth Direction:    East</span><br />
In personal feng shui, the east is your growth and wisdom direction.  Work in this location to improve your standing, study in this direction, and locate beneficial activities here, such as dining to improve all areas of life.  Are you trying to start over from any kind of setback?  If so, this is direction to face or be in.  Add a beautiful plants here -- such as bamboo -- to get your growing again!  Lights are also excellent enhancers for plants, so consider draping white lights on your plants for an extra dose of good feng shui.</p>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Unlucky Directions: Southwest, Northwest, Northeast, West</span><br />
Try to avoid the southwest sector and/or direction.  To do so can cause arguments and legal problems or some kind of accident. You will receive blame for problems if you occupy this sector too much.</p>
<p>The northwest and northeast can cause accidents, misfortune, and difficulties, such as lawsuits, burglary or fire.  If your front door faces this direction, your family may leave you.  If you have a business with a front door facing this direction, employees may leave.   This is a good location for a kitchen or toilet.</p>
<p>Strenuously avoid the west because it is the VERY worst direction for you.  A front door facing this direction can lead to a loss of children or other close family members. Infertility can also arise, causing the family name to die out.  Wealth will also be lost.  This is a good location for a kitchen or a toilet.</p>
