A front door located here will also bring honor from someone of prominence.  Enhance this location with metal objects or stone objects to give health a boost.  Eat or work in this location when getting over an illness.  Use objects in groups of seven, such as seven crystal balls. Decorate in colors of white, gray, or silver.<br />

</p>

<p>  <span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Love Direction:    Northwest</span><br />

  The northwest is the &quot;heaven&quot; location and benefits from having round shapes here.  Stimulate romance by putting a small fan on a 6-rod hollow windchime.  Enhance this area to create good relationships with anyone.  Add a stereo or radio here to enhance your love life.<br />

</p>

<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Growth Direction:    Southwest</span><br />

  In personal feng shui, the southwest is your growth and wisdom direction.  Work in this location to improve your standing, study in this direction, and locate beneficial activities here, such as dining to improve all areas of life.  Are you trying to start over from any kind of setback?  If so, this is direction to face or be in.  Enhance this area with globes, vases, or pictures of mountains or maps. <br />

</p>

<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Unlucky Directions: East, Southeast, South, North</span><br />

Try to avoid the east sector and/or direction.  To do so can cause arguments and legal problems or some kind of accident.  You will receive blame for problems if you occupy this sector too much. </p>

<p>The southeast and south can cause accidents, misfortune, and difficulties, such as lawsuits, burglary or fire.  If your front door faces this direction, your family may leave you.  If you have a business with a front door facing this direction, employees may leave.   This is a good location for a kitchen or toilet.</p>

<p>Strenuously avoid the north because it is the VERY worst direction for you.  A front door facing this direction can lead to a loss of children or other close family members. Infertility can also arise, causing the family name to die out.  Wealth will also be lost.  This is a good location for a kitchen or a toilet.</p>
