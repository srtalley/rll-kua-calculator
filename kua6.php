<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">How to Tap Your Auspicious Directions</span><br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to sleep, eat, work, or be in this sector of your home <br />
  </li>
  <li>Do as many activities as possible in this sector<br />
  </li>
  <li>Face this direction when working, eating, or sitting in your living room <br />
  </li>
  <li>Sleep with the top of your head pointed in this direction<br />
  </li>
  <li>Enter your home or office from a door that faces these direction<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Wealth &amp; Success Direction:    West</span><br />
Enhance this direction with metal objects in groups of seven.  Swords, knives, metal objects are all suitable for this sector (unless it is a bedroom).  Vases, crystals, stones, and earth objects are also wonderful in this location because metal comes from earth, so the more earth elements you have the more successful -- and wealthy -- you can be. </p>
<p>Create a wealth bowl out of porcelain and add gold-colored objects, semi-precious stones, dirt from a wealthy person's house, and faux diamonds to boost your success.  White, silver, gray, and gold-colored objects are perfect here.  Add lots of shiny objects to attract more success!  A front door in this location will bring prosperity to you.</p>
<p>Do everything you can to use this direction to promote your wealth and success!  Mountain images are perfect for placing on the wealth and success wall of your home or office because they symbolize the &quot;big earth&quot; element.</p>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Health Direction: Northeast</span><br />
  This is an excellent direction for objects such as beautiful vases or porcelain bowls.  Add stones in this location.  Decorate in purple, beiges, or taupes to improve health.  Candles and bright lights are also excellent health energizers for you!  If your front door is here, you and your family will be very wealthy.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Love Direction:    Southwest</span><br />
The southwest is the direction of love.  Lucky for you, this is compounded because this is your personal feng shui direction for love!  Boost this sector by decorating in pairs of two's -- two figurines of birds, etc.  Add candles to this location to boost the romance potential even further.  Another fantastic addition?  A beautiful bubbling fountain -- with a light!  Great for singles as the fountain brings lots of wonderful yang energy.</p>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Growth Direction:    Northwest</span><br />
  In personal feng shui, the northwest is your growth and wisdom direction.  Work in this location to improve your standing, study in this direction, and locate beneficial activities here, such as dining to improve all areas of life.  Are you trying to start over from any kind of setback?  If so, this is direction to face or be in.  Add a windchime here and place a fan to blow on it.  This will help you get going.  Need to write a lot with your job?  The fan will help keep creativity high!<br />
</p>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Unlucky Directions: Southeast, East, North, South</span><br />
Try to avoid the southeast sector and/or direction.  To do so can cause arguments and legal problems or some kind of accident. You will receive blame for problems if you occupy this sector too much or if your front door faces this direction.</p>
<p>The east and north can cause accidents, misfortune, and difficulties, such as lawsuits, burglary or fire.  If your front door faces this direction, your family may leave you.  If you have a business with a front door facing this direction, employees may leave.   This is a good location for a kitchen or toilet.</p>
<p>Strenuously avoid the south because it is the VERY worst direction for you.  A front door facing this direction can lead to a loss of children or other close family members. Infertility can also arise, causing the family name to die out.  Wealth will also be lost.  This is a good location for a kitchen or a toilet.</p>
