<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Wealth &amp; Success Direction:    Southwest</span><br />

Enhance this direction with stones, candles, bright lights, vases, crystal, or porcelain.  You may also use lights, candles, or lamps.  Add objects in groups of eight, such as eight bright lights.  Red colors are also extremely beneficial.  This direction helps boost your prominence and stature, so do be sure to face this direction as much as possible -- particularly at work.  Decorate in colors of beige, yellow, taupe or in red, orange, or purple. </p>

<p>Do everything you can to use this direction to promote your wealth and success!  Mountain images are perfect for placing on the wealth and success wall of your home or office because they symbolize the &quot;big earth&quot; element.</p>

<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Health Direction: Northwest</span><br />

  Enhance this location with metal objects or stone objects to give health a boost.  Eat or work in this location when getting over an illness.  A six-rod hollow windchime is an excellent enhancer for this location, as is a beautiful metal vase.</p>

<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Love Direction: West   </span><br />

  Enhance this area with small metal objects, round objects, or stone objects.  Shiny and reflective items are especially helpful for stimulating romance.  Decorate in colors of white, silver, or grays.  Yellow are also helpful.  Add a radio to this location to boost romance!</p>

<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Growth Direction:    Northeast</span><br />

  In personal feng shui, the northeast is your growth and wisdom direction.  Work in this location to improve your standing, study in this direction, and locate beneficial activities here, such as dining to improve all areas of life.  Are you trying to start over from any kind of setback?  If so, this is direction to face or be in.  Add a beautiful vase here will help to capture beneficial chi!</p>

<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Unlucky Directions: South, North, East, Southeast</span><br />

Try to avoid the south sector and/or direction.  To do so can cause arguments and legal problems or some kind of accident. You will receive blame for problems if you occupy this sector too much or if your front door faces this direction.</p>

<p>The north and east can cause accidents, misfortune, and difficulties, such as lawsuits, burglary or fire.  If your front door faces this direction, your family may leave you.  If you have a business with a front door facing this direction, employees may leave.   This is a good location for a kitchen or toilet.</p>

<p>Strenuously avoid the southeast because it is the VERY worst direction for you.  A front door facing this direction can lead to a loss of children or other close family members. Infertility can also arise, causing the family name to die out.  Wealth will also be lost.  This is a good location for a kitchen or a toilet.</p>
