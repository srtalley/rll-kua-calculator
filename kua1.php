<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Growth Direction:    North</span><br />
  In personal feng shui, the north is your growth and wisdom direction.  Work in this location to improve your standing, study in this direction, and locate beneficial activities here, such as dining to improve all areas of life.  Are you trying to start over from any kind of setback?  If so, this is direction to face or be in. <br />
</p>
<p><span class="rlkc-kua-desc-heading">Your Unlucky Directions: West, Northeast, Northwest, Southwest</span><br />
Try to avoid the west sector and/or direction.  To do so can cause arguments and legal problems or some kind of accident. You will receive blame for problems if you occupy this sector too much or if your front door faces this direction. </p>
<p>The northeast and northwest can cause accidents, misfortune, and difficulties, such as lawsuits, burglary or fire.  If your front door faces this direction, your family may leave you.  If you have a business with a front door facing this direction, employees may leave.   This is a good location for a kitchen or toilet.</p>
<p>Strenuously avoid the southwest because it is the VERY worst direction for you.  A front door facing this direction can lead to a loss of children or other close family members. Infertility can also arise, causing the family name to die out.  Wealth will also be lost.  This is a good location for a kitchen or a toilet.</p>
